Subject: Submission of manuscript on CO2-based occupancy duration inference in dormitory rooms

Dear Editor,

Please consider our manuscript, "Inferring Occupancy Duration from Indoor CO2 Concentrations in University Dormitory Rooms: A Block-Level Excess Approach with Monte Carlo Uncertainty Quantification," for publication in Building and Environment.

This work presents a physics-based method to infer occupied minutes within 4-hour blocks from indoor CO2 measurements in dormitory rooms. The method is designed for practical settings where minute-level occupancy ground truth is unavailable, but block-level present/absent labels are available.

The manuscript provides three primary contributions:

1. A block-level, carryover-aware CO2 duration estimator grounded in AR(1) mass-balance dynamics, with per-sensor empty-room calibration and innovation-noise gating.
2. Full uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo propagation that includes both parameter uncertainty and structural mismatch priors.
3. A structured validation framework that separates calibration diagnostics from independent criteria, including temporal out-of-sample checks, cross-sensor generalization tests, sensitivity analysis, and semisynthetic stress testing.

In the final model configuration, all predefined independent criteria and temporal out-of-sample diagnostics pass. The method remains computationally lightweight and requires no minute-level supervised training labels.
The manuscript has been formatted for concise full-length submission (abstract under 250 words; 9 figures and 4 tables in the main text).

This manuscript is original, has not been published previously, and is not under consideration elsewhere. All authors approve this submission.

Ethics: The study was approved by our Institutional Review Board (IRB ID: [TO_BE_ADDED]). Informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Competing interests: The authors declare no competing interests.

Data and code availability: The repository with code and reproducible derived outputs is available at
