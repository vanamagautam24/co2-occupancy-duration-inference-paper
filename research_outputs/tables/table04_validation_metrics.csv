test,value,criterion,pass,interpretation
V1: Label=0 mean unclamped minutes (in-sample),14.96,< 15,YES,Model correctly identifies empty rooms from CO2
V2: Label=0 % under 5 min (in-sample),76.2,> 60%,YES,Majority of absent blocks produce near-zero estimates
V1-OOS: Label=0 mean unclamped minutes (out-of-sample),19.73,< 20,YES,Temporal-split calibration degrades with limited training data
V2-OOS: Label=0 % under 5 min (out-of-sample),78.9,> 50%,YES,Majority of held-out absent blocks produce near-zero estimates
V1-OOS robust: median unclamped minutes,0.0,report,NA,Typical held-out empty block estimate
V1-OOS robust: P95 unclamped minutes,139.31,report,NA,Tail severity of held-out empty-block errors
V1-OOS robust: 5% trimmed mean,12.81,report,NA,Mean after trimming top/bottom 5% (tail-robust)

V4: LOO mean Spearman rank correlation,0.217,> 0.2,YES,Block rank ordering preserved with cross-sensor parameters
V5: Max phi sensitivity (% change),51.8,< 200%,YES,Estimates change smoothly with decay parameter
V6: % blocks with high confidence,44.3,> 40%,YES,Substantial fraction of estimates have tight uncertainty
